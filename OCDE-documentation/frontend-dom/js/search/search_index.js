version 10.1.6. It is expected to be run along with with XAMPP on a linux (Ubuntu) computer.\nThis project has mainly 3 kind of code files : Angular code files (for frontend), PHP scripts (for backend) and MySQL script (for backend).\nClone Repository\nAfter installing Angular CLI (version 10.1.6) and XAMPP on your linux computer, clone/save this project repository/directory inside the /opt/lampp/htdocs/ directory.\nMake sure that you recursively change the permissions for the sfcode/ directory (project directory) and its subdirectories (It is recommended that they be set to 777).\nSet Up Backend\nStart the XAMPP servers by going into /opt/lampp directory and using the command ./xampp start as a superuser. \nNow, if you are using XAMPP for this project for the first time, the follow these steps:\n\nOpen your browser and go to the adress http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and create a MySQL database with name ssl_database.\nGo into the created database and import the script present in backend/database.sql script from the project repository, which create two tables : users and questions.\n\nStart Angular Server\nOpen a terminal in the project directory, /opt/lampp/htdocs/sfcode. Now, follow these steps:\n\nUse npm install.\nUse ng build to build the project.\nUse ng serve to start angular server at http://localhost:4200/. If you wish to make the website to be available to your local network, use ng serve --host local_ip --port port_noHere, local_ip is your computer's local ip adress and port_no is the port number (default value 4200) at which the website will be hosted. Use the ip adress 0.0.0.0 to make it available from any network. Note that the XAMPP server is already running while you are following the above three steps. The XAMPP server can also be started after starting the angular server, using ./xampp start command in the /opt/lampp/ directory.\n\nNow, you can open the website on your browser and the default Registration/Login page will open. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
